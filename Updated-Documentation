Documentation: Building a Custom ML Model for News Image Recommendation System
Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the project to develop a news image recommendation system using a custom machine learning (ML) model. The system aims to suggest relevant images for news articles by leveraging feature extraction techniques and advanced ML models for both text and images.

1. Project Objectives
Design and implement a custom ML model to recommend images for news articles.
Develop mechanisms to extract meaningful features from both textual and visual data.
Create a system that aligns images and text in a joint embedding space for similarity-based recommendations.

2. Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
Dataset Acquisition:


Gather datasets that provide paired news articles and images.
Use publicly available datasets such as:
BBC News Dataset for articles.
COCO Dataset for images.
Data Preprocessing:


Text:
Clean and preprocess text data to remove unnecessary elements like HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
Apply tokenization and lemmatization techniques.
Images:
Resize all images to a uniform size and normalize their pixel values.
Prepare images for feature extraction by converting them into formats suitable for model input.

Step 2: Feature Extraction
Text Features:


Utilize methods like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or train a custom embedding layer.
Capture semantic meaning and relationships between words.
Image Features:


Extract visual features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other computer vision models.
Train custom CNNs or use pre-trained models for efficiency.

Step 3: Multimodal Model Development
Objective:


Create a model capable of aligning text and image features into a shared embedding space.
Architecture:


Design a custom model architecture that processes text and image inputs independently before merging them into a joint space.
Use dense layers to refine the embeddings for both modalities.
Loss Function:


Implement a loss function that optimizes the alignment of related text and image pairs while differentiating unrelated pairs.

Step 4: Model Training
Data Preparation:


Create pairs of matched and unmatched text-image samples for training.
Ensure proper batching and shuffling to maintain diversity during training.
Training Parameters:


Optimize the model using an appropriate optimizer like Adam.
Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs for best results.

Step 5: Recommendation Logic
Process:


For a given news article, generate its embedding using the trained model.
Compare the article embedding with pre-computed image embeddings.
Rank images based on their similarity scores to the article.
Output:


Return the top-ranked images as recommendations.

Step 6: Deployment
Export Models:


Save the trained models in a format compatible with deployment (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel format).
Integration:


Deploy the model as a REST API using tools like Flask or FastAPI.
Host the solution on AWS services such as SageMaker, Lambda, or EC2.

Step 7: Evaluation
Metrics:


Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Assess ranking quality with metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
Feedback:


Collect user feedback to fine-tune the system for improved performance.

3. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Cloud Services: AWS SageMaker, Amazon S3
Data Processing Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK
